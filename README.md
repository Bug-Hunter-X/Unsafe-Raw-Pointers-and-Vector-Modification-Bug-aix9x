This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Rust involving raw pointers and vector modification. The `bug.rs` file showcases the unsafe code that leads to undefined behavior, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer alternative using proper Rust techniques.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management and avoiding potential pitfalls when working with raw pointers in Rust.
